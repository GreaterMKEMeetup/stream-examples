# stream-examples

#SQL Like Operation
The examples of using Java8 streams are executed using JUnit tests.

The fist set of examples uses org.gmjm.streams.WeaterStreamTests.java
 
These examples perform SQL like operations on the weather data.

#Data Analysis
The second examples are in org.gmjm.streams.BookStreamTests.java.

These examples analyze a large collection of strings from a file quickly.

#Data Manipulation
The third set of examples in org.gmjm.streams.crypto.* use ciphers to show how streams can be used to manipulate a stream of data.

You can create and test your own implementation of the Cipher class for fun.
